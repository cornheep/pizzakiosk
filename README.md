# PizzaKiosk


Experimenting with making a kiosk of pizza ordering system. Also serves as my learning of C++ since I think I'm a project-based learner lol.


### To compile the code:

```bash
g++ -o 'custom filename' ptest.cpp
g++ -o 'custom filename' pizza.cpp
```

### To run the compiled program:

```bash
./filename
```
### To be integrated:

- Delete items
- Delete previous output of terminal (CLI)
- GUI (probably will take a month)
