A pizza ordering kiosk system built as a hands-on project for learning C++. This project will have **two distinct versions**: a **CLI (Command-Line Interface)** version and a **GUI (Graphical User Interface)** version.


## Getting Started

### Compilation

#### Use g++ or clang++

For g++:

```bash
g++ -o program_name ptest.cpp
g++ -o program_name pizza.cpp
```

For clang:

```bash
clang++ -o program_name ptest.cpp
clang++ -o program_name pizza.cpp
```

### Running the Program

Execute the compiled program:
```bash
./program_name
```

## Planned Features

### CLI Version
-  Order pizza with customizable toppings
-  View and modify cart
-  Delete items from order
-  Clear terminal output
-  Order confirmation and receipt

### GUI Version
-  Visual interface for pizza selection
-  Interactive topping customization
-  Cart management
-  Order summary and checkout
-  *Estimated development time: ~3 months. Will be started after the final version of the CLI version*


## Development Status

- Currently in early development 
- Working with the CLI version and planning to implement GUI soon.
